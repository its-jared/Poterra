Explore the world of Poterra.

**WORK IN PROGRESS!!!**

## Idea
- Buy more land (chunks) with various resources that become increasingly expensive over time. For example, it'll start with 15 pieces of wood and 5 stones, and towards the end it'll be various precious materials that are difficult to find. The purchace will be made at the ends of the map, you can hover over the chunk and buy it. 
- Underground sections. These will be connected to the surface chunk, and will have various enimies and materials.
- Day and Night.
- Special Eye Ball enimie that can only be killed when it looks into a mirror. It follows the player, even through blocks allowing you to have it look into a mirror. When this enimie is present, it increases the spawn rate of other enimies.
